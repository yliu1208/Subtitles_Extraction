1
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,075
Do you consider the book
to be autobiographical?

2
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,609
Well, I mean...

3
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,582
...isn't everything autobiographical?

4
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:01,144
I mean, we all see the world
through our own tiny keyhole, right?

5
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,369
I mean, I always think
of Thomas Wolfe.

6
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,782
Have you ever seen that little
one-page "Note to Reader"...

7
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,121
<i>...in the front
of Look Homeward, Angel?</i>

8
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,715
Anyway, he says that we are the sum
of all the moments of our lives...

9
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,722
...and anybody who sits down to write
will use the clay of their own life...

10
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,534
...that you can't avoid that.

11
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:25,475
So when I look at my own life,
I have to admit, right, that I...

12
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,291
I've never been around a bunch of guns
or violence, you know, not really.

13
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,446
No political intrigue
or a helicopter crash, right?

14
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:39,151
But my life, from my own point of view,
has been full of drama, right?

15
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,306
And so I thought,
if I could write a book...

16
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,852
...that could capture what it's like
to really meet somebody...

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,810
One of the most exciting things
that's happened to me...

18
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,281
...is to meet somebody,
make that connection.

19
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,468
And if I could make that valuable,
you know, to capture that...

20
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,453
...that would be the attempt, or...

21
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,528
Did I answer your question?

22
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,534
I'll try to be more specific.

23
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,697
Was there ever a French young woman
on a train you met...

24
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,211
...and spent an evening with?

25
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,994
See, to me, that... I mean...

26
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,592
...that's not important, you know?
- So that's a yes?

27
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,495
All right, since I'm in France and this
is the last stop of my book tour, yes.

28
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,210
Thank you.

29
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,736
Mr. Wallace, the book ends
on an ambiguous note.

30
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,321
We don't know.

31
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,058
Do you think they get back together
in six months...

32
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,657
...like they promise each other?

33
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,261
Like they promised?

34
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,528
I think how you answer that,
you know, is...

35
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,630
It's a good test, right,
if you're a romantic or a cynic.

36
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,816
Right? I mean, you think
they get back together, right?

37
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,632
- You don't, for sure.
- No.

38
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,774
And you hope they do,
but you're not sure.

39
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,589
- That's why you're asking the question.
- Do you think they get back together?

40
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,989
I mean, did you in real life?

41
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,292
Did I in real...?

42
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,218
Look, in the words
of my grandfather, okay:

43
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,495
"To answer that would take
the piss out of the whole thing. "

44
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,863
We just have the time
for one last question.

45
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,857
What is your next book?

46
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,904
I don't know, man. I don't know.

47
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,578
I've been...
I've been thinking about this...

48
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,490
Well, I always kind of wanted
to write a book...

49
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,289
...that all took place
within the space of a pop song.

50
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,645
Like three or four minutes long,
the whole thing.

51
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,346
The story, the idea,
is that there's this guy, right...

52
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,296
...and he's totally depressed.

53
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,614
His great dream was to be a lover,
an adventurer, you know...

54
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,598
...riding motorcycles
through South America.

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,559
And instead he's sitting
at a marble table eating lobster.

56
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,798
He's got a good job and
a beautiful wife, right, but that...

57
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,324
Everything that he needs.
But that doesn't matter...

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,513
...because what he wants
is to fight for meaning.

59
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,042
You know? Happiness
is in the doing, right?

60
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,548
Not in the getting what you want.

61
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,211
So he's sitting there,
and just that second...

62
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:21,598
...his little 5-year-old daughter
hops up on the table.

63
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,097
And he knows that she should
get down, because she could get hurt.

64
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,966
But she's dancing to this pop song
in a summer dress.

65
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,700
And he looks down...

66
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,388
...and all of a sudden, he's 6.

67
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:41,569
And his high-school sweetheart
is dropping him off at home.

68
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,402
And they just lost their virginity,
and she loves him...

69
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,508
...and the same song is playing
on the car radio.

70
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,766
And she climbs up and starts dancing
on the roof of the car.

71
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,582
And now he's worried about her.

72
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,931
And she's beautiful, with a facial
expression just like his daughter's.

73
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,512
In fact, maybe that's why
he even likes her.

74
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,618
You see, he knows he's not
remembering this dance...

75
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,497
...he's there. He's there,
in both moments, simultaneously.

76
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,144
And just for an instant,
all his life is just folding in on itself.

77
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,091
And it's obvious to him
that time is a lie.

78
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,857
That it's all happening all the time...

79
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,566
...and inside every moment
is another moment...

80
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,719
...all happening simultaneously.

81
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,969
Anyway, that's kind of the idea.
Anyway.

82
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,707
Our author has to be going
to the airport soon...

83
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,816
...so thank you all very much
for coming over this afternoon.

84
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,263
And a special thanks to Mr. Wallace
for being with us.

85
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,960
Thank you. Thank you.

86
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,786
We hope to see you here again
with your next book.

87
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,724
Thank you all. How much longer
before I have to go to the airport?

88
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,597
Oh, you should leave at 7:30...

89
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,349
- Seven-thirty at the very latest.
- Okay.

90
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,537
- Hi.
- Hello.

91
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,898
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

92
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,481
I'm good, yeah, I'm great. I'm...

93
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,625
Do you wanna, maybe,
get a cup of coffee?

94
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,837
Didn't he just say
you have a plane to catch?

95
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,783
Yeah. But, I mean, I have a little time.

96
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,431
- Okay.
- Yeah? All right, well, let me...

97
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,775
I'll meet you outside. Okay.

98
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,896
Excuse me. I'm just gonna go
get a cup of coffee.

99
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,357
- I'll be back at 7: 5.
- Did you sign all these?

100
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,140
- Yeah, I sure did.
- Get your driver Philippe's card...

101
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,851
...so you can call his cell
if you're running late.

102
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,641
We'll put your bags in the car
so you're not late.

103
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,401
- All right, thanks for everything.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,724
Which one's Philippe?

105
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,939
- I can't believe you're here.
- I live here in Paris.

106
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,694
Are you sure you don't have to stay?
You're not supposed to talk more?

107
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,998
They're sick of me.
I spent the night here.

108
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,491
- You did?
- Yeah, they got a loft upstairs.

109
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,282
- How are you? This is so weird.
- I'm fine.

110
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,141
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

111
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,991
- So you want to go to a café?
- Yeah.

112
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,584
Okay. There's one a little further
that I like.

113
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,563
I thought I was gonna totally lose it
in there when I first saw you.

114
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,613
How did you know
I was gonna be here?

115
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:51,099
It's my favorite bookstore in Paris.
You can sit down for hours and read.

116
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,359
I love it. There's fleas,
but, you know...

117
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,891
I know. I think a cat slept
on my head last night.

118
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,675
I saw your picture on the calendar
about a month ago...

119
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,752
...and that you were going
to be here.

120
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,047
It's funny, because I read an article
on your book...

121
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:08,170
...and it sounded vaguely familiar.
- Vaguely? Yeah.

122
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,390
But I didn't put it all together
until I saw your photo. So...

123
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,789
Did you have a chance to read it?

124
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,449
Yes, I...

125
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,036
I was really, really surprised,
as you can imagine.

126
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,865
I mean, I had to read it twice, actually.

127
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,143
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,162
No, I liked it. It's very romantic.

129
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,003
I usually don't like that,
but it's really well-written.

130
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,199
- It's well-written. Congratulations.
- All right. Thank you.

131
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,538
- Wait.
- What?

132
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,614
Before we go anywhere,
I have to ask you...

133
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,719
Sure. What?

134
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,835
Did you show up in Vienna
that December?

135
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,994
- Did you?
- No, I couldn't. But did you?

136
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,573
- I need to know. It's important to me.
- Why, if you didn't?

137
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,007
Well, did you?

138
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,697
No.

139
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,826
Thank God you didn't.

140
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,821
- Oh, my God.
- Thank God you didn't.

141
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,461
Thank God I didn't and you didn't.
If one of us had showed up alone...

142
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,084
...that would have sucked.
- I was so concerned.

143
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,070
I felt horrible about not being there,
but I couldn't. My grandma died...

144
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,598
...and she was buried that day,
December 6th.

145
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,377
- The one in Budapest?
- Yes. You remember that?

146
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,377
- I remember everything.
- Of course, it was in your book.

147
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,816
But anyway, I was about to
fly to Vienna, you know...

148
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:31,047
...and we heard the news about her,
and of course I had to go to the funeral.

149
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,053
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

150
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,894
I know. But you weren't there anyway.

151
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,651
Wait. Why weren't you there?

152
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,170
I would have been there
if I could have. I made plans...

153
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,634
You better have a good reason.

154
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,211
What?

155
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,756
Oh, no.

156
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,440
No, you were there, weren't you?

157
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,297
Oh, no, that's terrible!

158
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,252
I'm laughing, but I don't mean it.

159
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,288
Did you hate me?
You must've hated me.

160
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,685
- Have you been hating me all this time?
- No.

161
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,228
- Yes, you have.
- No.

162
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,249
But you can't hate me now, right?

163
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,533
- I mean, my grandma...
- I don't hate you. It's no big deal.

164
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,312
I flew all the way over there,
you blew the thing off.

165
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,588
My life's been a big nosedive since,
but it's not a problem.

166
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,644
- No, I'm kidding.
- Don't say that. I can't believe it.

167
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,325
You must have been so angry
with me. I'm so sorry.

168
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,032
I wanted to be there,
more than anything in the world.

169
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,948
- Honestly, I swear...
- You can't be angry, my grandmother...

170
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,743
I know. I honestly thought that something
like that might have happened.

171
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,057
I was definitely bummed, but...

172
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,867
Mostly I was mad we hadn't exchanged
any phone numbers or any information.

173
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,108
That was so stupid.
No way to get in touch.

174
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,596
- Nothing to go on.
- I didn't know your last name.

175
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,940
Remember, we were both afraid
if we started writing and calling...

176
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,636
...that it would slowly fade out.
- It definitely wasn't a slow fade.

177
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,152
No, it sure wasn't.

178
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,129
We wanted to pick up
where we left off.

179
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,610
Which would have been fine
if it had worked. Oh, well.

180
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,571
So...

181
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,291
- How long were you in Vienna, then?
- Just a couple days.

182
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,043
Did you meet another girl?

183
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,819
Yeah, her name was Gretchen
and she was amazing.

184
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,739
The book's really a composite
of the two of you.

185
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,694
No, I'm kidding. You wouldn't believe...
I even went back to the train station.

186
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,982
I put up signs of my number
in the hotel in case you'd been delayed.

187
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,837
- I was a total dork.
- Let's go this way. Did you get any calls?

188
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,284
Just a couple hookers
looking for a gig.

189
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,055
No, it was awful, I mean,
what do you want me to say?

190
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,685
It's so sad. I'm so sorry.

191
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,917
I walked around for a couple days.
Eventually, I flew home.

192
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,404
I owed my dad 2000 bucks...

193
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,626
...who had warned me
about French chicks.

194
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,722
What did he tell you
about French women?

195
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,002
Nothing. He's never met
any French women.

196
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,454
He's never been
east of the Mississippi.

197
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,797
Why didn't you put, "Six months later,
the French bitch didn't show up"?

198
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,658
No, but I did, I did.

199
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,736
- You did?
- Yeah. No. I made it more hopeful.

200
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,500
I wrote this fictional version
where you do show up.

201
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,174
- Oh, what happens?
- Well...

202
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,131
What?

203
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,494
We make love for about 0 days straight,
that's one part of it.

204
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,459
- Interesting. So the French slut, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

205
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,178
It's just then they get
to know each other better...

206
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,370
...and realize they don't
get along at all.

207
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,820
- I like that. It's more real.
- My editor didn't think that way.

208
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,167
Everyone wants to believe in love.
It sells.

209
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,336
Yeah, exactly, so...

210
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,604
So things are going well for you,
right? I mean...

211
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,002
- Your book is a bestseller in the U.S.
- It's a tiny bestseller.

212
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,262
- Oh, come on.
- All right. Officially, yes.

213
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,553
<i>Most people haven't read Moby Dick.
Why should they read my book?</i>

214
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,006
<i>I haven't read Moby Dick
and I liked your book.</i>

215
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,470
- Thanks.
- Even though...

216
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,417
...I thought you idealized
the night of it.

217
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,377
Come on, it's fiction, right?

218
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,208
- I'm supposed to...
- I know, I know.

219
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,565
I know. I thought there were times
where you made me...

220
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:54,111
Well, I mean, her, right?
No, me. Okay, whatever.

221
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,417
- A little bit neurotic.
- You are a bit like that, aren't you?

222
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,871
- You think I'm neurotic?
- No, no, no. Come on, I'm kidding.

223
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,971
Where did I do that? I didn't do that.

224
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,812
Oh, maybe it's just me, you know...

225
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:09,008
Reading something, knowing
the character is based on you...

226
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,909
...it's both flattering and disturbing
at the same time.

227
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,660
How is it disturbing?

228
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,976
I don't know. Just being part
of someone else's memory.

229
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,830
Seeing myself through your eyes.

230
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,420
How long did it take you to write it?

231
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,207
Three or four years, on and off.

232
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,528
Wow, that's a really long time
to be writing about one night.

233
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,429
Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.

234
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,186
I always assumed
you had forgotten me.

235
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,348
No, I had a pretty clear picture
of you in my mind.

236
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,979
- I have to tell you something. I just...
- What?

237
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,885
I've wanted to talk to you for so long
that now... It's just surreal, you know?

238
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,932
I feel like everything should be...

239
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,487
How long do we have?
Twenty minutes and 30 seconds?

240
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,001
We got more than that.
I wanna know about you.

241
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,822
Tell me, what are you doing?
What are you up to?

242
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:59,582
Where to start? I work for Green Cross.
It's an environmental organization.

243
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,257
What are they all about?

244
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,994
We basically work on different
environment issues...

245
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,793
...from clean water to
disarmament of chemical weapons.

246
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,428
International laws that deal
with the environment.

247
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,976
- What do you do for them?
- We're going this way.

248
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,769
Different things.

249
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,748
Like, last year I was in India for a while,
working on a water-treatment plant.

250
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,907
Well, the cotton industry there
is a major source of pollution, so...

251
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,011
I mean, it sounds like you're actually
doing something.

252
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,652
Most people, myself included,
just sit around and bitch.

253
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,441
You know, how America's consuming
all the world's resources, SUVs suck...

254
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,127
...global warming is real...

255
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,624
I'm relieved to hear you're not one
of those "freedom fries" Americans.

256
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,247
Hey, you know...
But how'd you get into that?

257
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,675
I came out of political science,
hoping to work for the government.

258
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,622
- And I did for a little while. Terrible.
- Not good?

259
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,417
Yeah, no. Anyway, I got really tired...
Let's go this way.

260
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,980
Having this endless conversation
with friends...

261
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,395
...about how the world
was falling to pieces.

262
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,015
So I decided what I really
wanted to do was...

263
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,531
...to find things that could be fixed
and try to fix them, you know?

264
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,474
You know, I always thought you'd be
doing something cool like that. I did.

265
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:11,551
Thanks. I just feel really, really lucky
to be doing a job I like, you know?

266
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,370
Yeah.

267
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:18,149
I actually alternate in between thinking
everything is irrevocably screwed up...

268
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,715
...and things might be
getting better in ways.

269
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,331
Better? How could you
possibly say that?

270
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,326
Well, I just mean, you know, like...

271
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,083
I know it sounds weird, but there are
things to be optimistic about.

272
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,963
Okay... I know your book is selling,
which is great, I'm very happy for you.

273
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,486
But let me break the news to you:
The world is a mess right now.

274
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,220
From a Western view,
things are getting a bit better.

275
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,978
We're moving industry to developing
nations where we can get cheap labor...

276
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,454
...free of any environmental laws.
The weapon industry is booming.

277
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,590
Five million people die a year
from preventable water disease.

278
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,805
How is the world getting better?
I'm not angry, I'm not angry.

279
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,130
But come on, I want to know.
I'm interested.

280
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,789
I realize that there are a lot
of serious problems in the world.

281
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,295
- Okay. Thank you.
- I mean, I don't even have...

282
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,836
...one publisher in the Asian market.
- Okay. All right.

283
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,484
- Say stop.
- What? Stop.

284
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,533
Look, all I'm saying is there's more
awareness. People are gonna fight back.

285
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,745
The world might be getting better
because people like you...

286
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,595
...are educated and speaking out.

287
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,319
Even the very notion of conservation,
environmental issues...

288
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,942
...weren't in the vocabulary
till fairly recently.

289
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:29,124
And they're becoming the norm and
eventually might be what's expected.

290
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,340
I agree with what you're saying,
but at the same time it's dangerous.

291
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,191
An imperialist country can use
that kind of thinking...

292
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,542
...to justify their economic greed.

293
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,979
Is there any particular imperialist country
you have in mind, there, Frenchie?

294
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,429
- No, not really.
- No?

295
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,301
- So you wanna sit over there?
- Yeah, this is perfect.

296
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,463
Oh, wow. Maybe what I'm saying is...

297
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,584
...the world might be evolving
the way a person evolves.

298
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,784
Like, I mean, me, for example.
Am I getting worse?

299
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,123
Am I improving? I don't know.
When I was younger, I was healthier...

300
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,852
...but I was wracked with insecurity,
you know?

301
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,582
Now I'm older and my problems
are deeper...

302
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,640
...but I'm more equipped
to handle them.

303
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,541
So, what are your problems?

304
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:24,495
Right now I don't have any.
I don't, you know? I'm just...

305
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,526
...damn happy to be here.

306
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,536
Me too.

307
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,761
So how long have you been in Paris?

308
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,348
I got in last night.
I've done 0 cities in 2 days.

309
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,931
I'm wrecked. I'm so glad it's over,
you know?

310
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,644
I'm tired of being a huckster.

311
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,721
- Hi.
- Hello.

312
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,432
What do you want?

313
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,586
A cup of coffee.

314
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:55,018
God, I love this café. I wish they had
places like this in the U.S.

315
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,982
Yeah, I missed cafés
when I was living over there.

316
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,057
I mean, I find a few places
I really liked, but there was...

317
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:05,225
- You were living in the U.S.?
- Yes, from '96 to '99.

318
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,116
I was studying at NYU.

319
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,078
Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine.

320
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,356
- What?
- No, it's just...

321
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,290
- Nothing, I mean, I...
- What?

322
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,760
I've been living in New York since '98.
We were there at the same time.

323
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,587
- In New York?
- Yeah.

324
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:24,342
That's weird. It actually crossed my mind
a few times that I might run into you...

325
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,936
...but the odds are so slim, right? So...

326
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,456
I didn't even know
what city you were in.

327
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,067
- Weren't you somewhere in Texas?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely. I just...

328
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,779
I was for a long time. I just,
you know, wanted to try New York.

329
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,562
What brought you back here?

330
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,758
I had finished my master's, for one...

331
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,174
...and no visa, no more visa.

332
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:49,675
And I was starting to get paranoid.
All the violence in the medias:

333
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,140
Gang violence, murders,
especially serial killers...

334
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,495
But the final straw was...

335
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,533
...one night I heard some noise
on my fire escape...

336
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,300
...so I called 9,
and the cops came eventually.

337
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,975
- Like three hours later.
- Yeah, after I had been raped and killed.

338
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,137
No, but it was a man
and a woman officer.

339
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,370
I was explaining what I had heard...

340
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,865
...when the woman had
to go move the police car.

341
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,768
I was left alone with the male cop.

342
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:20,285
Right away he asked me if I had a gun,
and I said, "No, of course not. "

343
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,432
And he told me, "Well, you better
think about getting one.

344
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,962
This is America, not France. Okay?"

345
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,260
And I said to him, "I have no idea
how to shoot a gun...

346
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,994
...and I have no interest
in firearms whatsoever. "

347
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,945
And that's when he pulled out his gun,
like this, and he went:

348
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,553
"Well, one day, you're gonna have
something like this in your face...

349
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,264
...and if you wanna have a long life...

350
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:49,583
...you're gonna have to choose
between you or them. "

351
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:55,032
And then they left. And the next morning
I called for an application to get a gun.

352
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,811
Me with a gun.
I mean, that's really scary.

353
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,169
But then I realized
something was wrong.

354
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,858
The way that cop had pulled his gun out,
and everything, right?

355
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,974
So I canceled my demand
for the gun...

356
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,216
...and I called the police and tried
to complain about that cop.

357
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,987
- What happened with that?
- It was so much paperwork...

358
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,991
...and then I got scared,
with my shitty student visa...

359
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,584
- Thought you'd get deported?
- Exactly. I gave up...

360
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,579
...and forgot about the whole thing.

361
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:23,299
- Well, I guess I never forgot.
- Obviously.

362
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,092
But still, you know,
I really enjoyed being there.

363
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,403
- There's lots of things I miss in the U.S.
- Yeah? Like what?

364
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,012
Well...

365
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,682
The overall good mood
people have there.

366
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,995
Like, even if it can be
bullshit sometimes.

367
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,929
Like, "How you doing?" "Great. "
"How you doing?" "Great!"

368
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,504
"Have a great day!"

369
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,482
I don't know. Parisians can be
so grumpy. Have you noticed?

370
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:50,363
No, everybody seems
pretty happy to me.

371
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,984
- They're not happy. No.
- They're not happy?

372
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:57,503
No, they are. I don't know. I just
mean French men. They drive me nuts.

373
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,178
What is it? What about them?

374
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,447
Well, they're very nice.
They're great, you know, to be around.

375
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,692
They love food, wine,
they're great cooks.

376
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,860
But I've had really bad luck with them.

377
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,676
Why? What do you mean?

378
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,457
- Well, I guess they're not as...
- What?

379
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,304
What's the word?

380
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,569
- Horny? They're not as horny.
- Horny?

381
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:23,040
Wait, listen to me on this one. In that
regard, I am proud to be an American.

382
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,216
And you should be.
In that regard only.

383
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,382
Have you ever spent time
in Eastern Europe?

384
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,321
Eastern... No, I don't.
Thank you.

385
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,945
I remember as a teenager
I went to Warsaw...

386
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,664
...when it was still
a strict communist regime.

387
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,257
- Which I don't approve of at all.
- Sure you don't.

388
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,479
- No, I don't.
- I'm just kidding.

389
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,535
But anyway, something about
being there was very interesting.

390
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,941
After a couple of weeks,
something changed in me.

391
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:52,281
The city was quite gloomy and gray...

392
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,219
...but after a while,
my brain seemed clearer.

393
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,092
I was writing more
in my journal...

394
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,414
...ideas I'd never thought of before...
- Communist ideas?

395
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,825
- Listen, I'm not...
- I'm sorry, I...

396
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,805
- Okay.
- Go on.

397
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,561
Okay. I'll send you to a gulag later.

398
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:11,156
No. But it took me a while to figure out
why I felt so different.

399
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,034
One day, as I was walking
through the Jewish cemetery...

400
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,141
...I don't know why,
but it occurred to me there...

401
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:20,105
...I realized that I had spent the last
two weeks away from most of my habits.

402
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,353
TV was in a language
I didn't understand...

403
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,249
...there was nothing to buy,
no advertisements anywhere...

404
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,088
...so all I'd been doing was...

405
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:31,875
...walk around, think, and write.
My brain felt like it was at rest...

406
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,723
...free from the consuming frenzy.
It was almost like a natural high.

407
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:40,439
I felt so peaceful inside.
No strange urge to be somewhere else...

408
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,111
...to shop...

409
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,416
It could have seemed
like boredom at first...

410
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,392
...but it became very, very soulful.

411
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,948
It was interesting, you know?

412
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,376
Can you believe it was nine years ago
we were walking around Vienna?

413
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:56,565
- Nine years? No, that's impossible.
- No, it was. It feels like two months.

414
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,767
But it was summer '94.

415
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,261
Do I look any different?

416
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,582
I do?

417
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,641
I'd have to see you naked.

418
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,951
- What?
- I know, I'm sorry.

419
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,517
Your hair was different back then.
It was like...

420
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,096
- It's the same... Oh, down.
- Yeah, take it down.

421
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,045
Down. Okay, it was down. Okay.

422
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,403
Well? Voilà.

423
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,185
So?

424
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,696
Okay, come on. Tell me.

425
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,229
Skinnier, I think. A little thinner.

426
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,869
Did you think I was fat before?

427
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,939
- No...
- Yeah, you thought I was a fatty.

428
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:42,148
No, you thought I was a fatty. You
wrote a book about a fat French girl.

429
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,313
- No, listen.
- Oh, no.

430
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,645
Seriously, all right? You look beautiful.

431
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,856
Do I look any different?

432
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,670
No. Not at all.
Actually, you have this line.

433
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,343
- I know.
- It's like a scar.

434
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:59,894
- A scar? Like a gunshot wound?
- No, no, no. I like it. I'm sorry.

435
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:06,014
I had this funny...
Well, horrible dream the other day.

436
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:11,136
I was having this awful nightmare
that I was 32.

437
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,541
And then I woke up,
and I was 23. So relieved.

438
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,357
And then I woke up for real,
and I was 32.

439
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,039
- Shit, man. It happens.
- Scary.

440
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,913
Time goes faster and faster.
Apparently, it's because...

441
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,499
...we don't renew synapses after
our 20s, so it's downhill from then on.

442
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,697
I like getting older, you know?
Life feels...

443
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,504
I don't know, it feels more immediate.
Like I can appreciate things more.

444
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,003
No, me too, actually. I really love it.

445
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,298
I was once...

446
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,901
...a drummer in a band.

447
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,635
- You were?
- Yeah. We were pretty good, actually.

448
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:49,000
But the lead-singer guy, he was just so
obsessed with us getting a record deal.

449
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:52,174
It's all we talked about, thought about,
getting bigger shows.

450
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,866
Everything was just focused on
the future all the time. And now...

451
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,978
...the band doesn't even exist anymore.

452
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,499
And looking back
at the shows we did play...

453
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:03,567
...even rehearsing, it was just
so much fun.

454
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:07,894
I just... Now I'd enjoy every minute of it.
Could I have a drag of that?

455
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,230
Well, your book has been published.
That's a pretty big deal.

456
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:14,688
You've been all around Europe.
Are you enjoying every minute of it?

457
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,330
- Not really.
- Not really?

458
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,938
No.

459
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,097
- Do you have another one of those?
- Yes, of course.

460
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,771
Here.

461
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,703
In my field, I see these people that...
Oh, sorry.

462
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,482
Come into it with big,
idealist visions...

463
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,398
...of becoming the leader
that will create a better world.

464
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,795
They enjoy the goal,
but not the process.

465
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,895
- Right.
- But the reality of it is...

466
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:43,417
...the true work of improving things
is in the little achievements.

467
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,603
- That's what you need to enjoy.
- What do you mean, exactly?

468
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,376
I was working for this organization
that helped villages in Mexico.

469
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,583
And their concerns was how
to get the pencils...

470
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,172
...sent to the kid
in those little country schools.

471
00:26:56,449 --> 00:27:00,124
It was not about big,
revolutionary ideas. It was about pencils.

472
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,972
I see the people that do the real work,
and what's really sad is that...

473
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,933
...the people that are
the most giving, hardworking...

474
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,326
...and capable of making
this world better...

475
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,621
...usually don't have the ego
and ambition to be a leader.

476
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,480
They don't see any interest
in superficial rewards.

477
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,714
They don't care if their name
ever appear in the press.

478
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,728
They actually enjoy the process
of helping others.

479
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:24,652
- They're in the moment.
- Yeah, but that's so hard...

480
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,734
...you know, to be in the moment.
I mean, I feel like I'm...

481
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:31,857
...designed to be slightly dissatisfied
with everything, you know?

482
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,582
It's like always trying
to better my situation.

483
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:38,214
I satisfy one desire,
and it just agitates another.

484
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,923
And then I think, to hell with it, right?
Desire's the fuel of life.

485
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,964
You know? Do you think it's true...

486
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,088
...that if we never wanted anything,
we'd never be unhappy?

487
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:53,253
I don't know. Not wanting anything,
isn't that a symptom of depression?

488
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:57,101
Yeah, that is, right?
I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?

489
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:00,939
Yeah. I don't know. It's what all
those Buddhist guys say, right?

490
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,581
Liberate yourself from desire,
and you'll find...

491
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,922
...you already have everything you need.
- But I feel alive...

492
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,943
...when I want something more
than basic survival needs.

493
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,950
Wanting, whether it's intimacy
with another person...

494
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:14,948
...or a pair of shoes, is beautiful.

495
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,626
I like that we have those
ever-renewing desires, you know?

496
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,628
Maybe it's this sense
of entitlement.

497
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,504
You know, like whenever you feel like
you deserve that new pair of shoes?

498
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:28,580
It's okay to want things, as long as you
aren't pissed off if you don't get them.

499
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,714
Life's hard. It's supposed to be.

500
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,880
If we didn't suffer, we wouldn't
learn a thing, you know?

501
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,213
So, what, are you Buddhist,
or something?

502
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,903
- No.
- No? Why not?

503
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,980
I don't know. The same reason I don't
really consider myself anything, really.

504
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,835
I decided a long time ago that
I was gonna be open to everything...

505
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:52,577
...but not buy into any one
and only belief system.

506
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:57,309
I went to this Trappist monastery
a couple years ago.

507
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,738
- Trappist?
- Yeah, they're Catholic. Cistercian.

508
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:05,628
- Why did you do that?
- Why? I'd been doing some reading.

509
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:09,671
Thought it'd be cool. Have you ever
spent any time with monks or nuns?

510
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,363
- No. It's not really my style.
- No?

511
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:18,174
Well, I expected them to be all
glowering and stern, but they weren't.

512
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,018
They were quick to laugh,
really easy to be around.

513
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,222
Seriously, very attuned to everything,
they were just...

514
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,906
You know, they weren't trying
to hustle anybody.

515
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:29,614
They're trying to live and die
in peace with God...

516
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,325
...or whatever part of them
they feel is eternal.

517
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,524
It was just so refreshing to be around.

518
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,163
You realize that most
of the people that you meet...

519
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,162
...are trying
to get somewhere better.

520
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:42,476
They're trying to make more cash,
get a little more respect...

521
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:45,133
...have more people admire them.
It's exhausting.

522
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:48,444
- No kidding.
- And it's exhausting to be one yourself.

523
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:52,019
There I am, right, you know,
all greedy to be more spiritual.

524
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:55,770
"I want to be a better person,"
you know? You can't escape.

525
00:29:56,087 --> 00:30:02,003
I had this boyfriend of mine many years
ago that wanted to be a Buddhist.

526
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:05,069
So he went to Asia to visit some
of those monasteries.

527
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:08,937
- I've thought about doing that too.
- Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why.

528
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:12,540
He was good-looking, and each time
he went to one of the monasteries...

529
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:15,368
...a monk offered to suck his cock.

530
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,328
True story.

531
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,657
It all comes down to that, doesn't it?

532
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,057
That's why I really admire
what you're doing.

533
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,401
- You know?
- What do you mean? Sucking cock?

534
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,737
- No.
- No? Wrong answer.

535
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:32,666
No, I was gonna say
you're not detached from life.

536
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,350
You're putting your passion into action.

537
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:38,229
Well, I try.

538
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:42,194
You know something?
I'm gonna be on planes...

539
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,739
...and in an airport
for the next eight hours...

540
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:47,328
I'd just love to see
a little bit more of Paris.

541
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,121
- Would you walk with me?
- Yeah.

542
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,623
- Do you mind?
- That's great.

543
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,723
- Do you want to?
- Let's do that. Yeah.

544
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,771
What do we owe here?
Four-fifty?

545
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,497
No, I got it, I got a little
per diem going on here.

546
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,924
- This good, for a tip?
- Yeah, that's fine.

547
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,465
- That's more than enough.
- Throw that in too.

548
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:06,177
- Is there anywhere to go around here?
- It's sales day today.

549
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:09,331
- What's that?
- It's when everything's on sale in Paris.

550
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,306
It's twice a year.

551
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,465
All right, let's go shopping.

552
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,701
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.
I don't wanna inflict that on you.

553
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:22,799
It's madness. Let's just go
to this garden path. It's really nice.

554
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,608
All right. That sounds
better than shopping, actually.

555
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,921
Not that I wouldn't do
whatever you wanted.

556
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:31,057
Sometimes I don't even need
to buy anything. I just get high...

557
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,067
...on trying on
and looking at things.

558
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,027
Is this where we're going?

559
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,420
- Yeah.
- A therapist will tell you that's good.

560
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,964
- Really? Are you ever in therapy?
- Oh, no.

561
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:43,187
- Do I seem like I'm in therapy?
- I'm kidding.

562
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:47,412
- Does it help your sex problems?
- My sex problems?

563
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,220
- I'm kidding.
- Tell me the truth.

564
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,642
- We didn't have any problems.
- No, I'm kidding.

565
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,308
- We didn't even have sex.
- That's a joke, right?

566
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:57,182
No, we didn't.
I mean, that was the whole thing.

567
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,415
- Of course we did.
- No, no, no, we didn't.

568
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,384
You didn't have a condom
and I never have sex without one.

569
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,511
I'm extremely paranoid.
There's no way...

570
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,233
I find it scary that you don't
remember what happened.

571
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,829
No, listen...

572
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,648
...I didn't write an entire book,
but I kept a journal...

573
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:15,761
...and I wrote the whole night in it.
That's what I meant, you idealizing it.

574
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,219
All right, listen, I even remember
what brand of condom we used.

575
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:21,353
That's disgusting.
I don't wanna hear it.

576
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:24,042
- That's not disgusting.
- No.

577
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:28,714
Okay, when I get home I'll check my
journal from '94, but I know I'm right.

578
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,616
- Wait a minute.
- What?

579
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,509
- Was it in the cemetery?
- No.

580
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,106
No, we went to the cemetery
in the afternoon.

581
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:42,174
It was in the park, very late at night.

582
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:44,741
- In the park?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

583
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,758
I can't... I can't...

584
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,910
Is it that forgettable? You really
don't remember? In the park?

585
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,981
Okay. Wait a minute,
I think you might be right...

586
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,581
You're messing with me now.

587
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,169
- No.
- Are you messing with me?

588
00:32:57,435 --> 00:33:00,472
Okay. No, I'm sorry. I think...
I mean, you're right, okay?

589
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:04,124
Sometimes I put things in drawers
inside my head and forget about it.

590
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,044
It's less painful to put things
away than live with it.

591
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,956
What, so that night was, like,
a sad memory for you?

592
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,033
I didn't mean that night
in particular.

593
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,274
I meant certain things
are better forgotten.

594
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:16,966
I remember that night
better than I do entire years.

595
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,006
- Me too.
- Really?

596
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,319
Well, I thought I did.

597
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:27,560
But maybe I... Maybe I put it away
because of the fact that...

598
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,874
...my grandmother's funeral was
the day we were supposed to meet.

599
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:34,052
It was a tough day for me,
but it must've been worse for you.

600
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:38,780
It was unreal. I remember looking
at her dead body in the coffin...

601
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:43,342
...at her beautiful hands, so warm,
so sweet, that used to hold me...

602
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,175
...but nothing in that coffin resembled
what I remembered of her.

603
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:48,998
All the warmth was gone.

604
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,994
And then I was crying,
so confused if I was crying...

605
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:57,640
...because I was never gonna see her
again or never gonna see you again...

606
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,754
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to go on like this.
I've been a little down this week.

607
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:05,003
- Why?
- I don't know. Nothing bad, just...

608
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,214
Reading your book, maybe?

609
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:11,173
No, but... Thinking of how hopeful
I was that summer and fall...

610
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,667
...and since then it's been kind of a...

611
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,699
I don't know.

612
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,923
Memory is a wonderful thing if
you don't have to deal with the past.

613
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,531
"Memory is wonderful if you don't
have to deal with the past. "

614
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,407
Can I put that
on a bumper sticker?

615
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,244
If you wrote a book about our night,
that's a good title.

616
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,237
- And it could be a total different book.
- Yeah, there'd be no sex scenes.

617
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,265
- But you know what?
- What?

618
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,853
Now that we've met again...

619
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,633
...we can change our memory
of that December 6.

620
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,190
It no longer has that sad ending
of us never seeing each other again.

621
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:48,820
Right. I mean, I guess a memory's
never finished as long as you're alive.

622
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:52,650
Yeah, I know. I have this memory
from my childhood...

623
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:55,477
...I realized recently never happened.
- What?

624
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:58,595
Well, when I was 8 or 9,
my mom was so paranoid...

625
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,643
...when I was walking home
from my piano lesson at night...

626
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,529
...she'd warn me about dirty old men
giving me candies...

627
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,565
...and then showing me
their pee-pees.

628
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:09,773
She was so obsessed with it that,
later in life, you know...

629
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:13,344
...I had this image in my head
that this really happened.

630
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:17,045
To the point that I even associated sex
with that walk home.

631
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,916
I mean, and sometimes,
even now, when I'm...

632
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:25,743
When I'm having sex, I see myself
walking down that street.

633
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:27,915
I swear. It's so weird, right?

634
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:32,208
- Is that street nearby? I mean, could...?
- Could we? No.

635
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,665
Very far.

636
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,361
Did you ever keep a journal
when you were a kid?

637
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:41,835
Yeah. On and off, I guess.

638
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,212
It's funny, I read one of mine...

639
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,274
...from '83 the other day.
- Yeah?

640
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:48,280
And what really surprised me is...

641
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:51,321
...that I was dealing with life
the same way I am now.

642
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:53,562
I was much more hopeful and naive...

643
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,938
...but the core, and the way I was
feeling things, is exactly the same.

644
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:00,513
It made me realize
I haven't changed much at all.

645
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,218
I don't think anybody does.

646
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:06,083
People don't want to admit it, but it's
like we have these innate set points...

647
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:09,886
...and nothing much that happens to us
changes our disposition.

648
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,610
- You believe that?
- I think so.

649
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,035
I read this study where they followed
people who'd won the lottery...

650
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,139
...and people who'd become paraplegics.

651
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:21,378
You'd think one extreme is gonna make
you euphoric and the other suicidal.

652
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:24,317
But the study shows that,
after about six months...

653
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,752
...as soon as people had gotten used to
their new situation...

654
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,293
...they were, more or less, the same.
- The same?

655
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:33,637
Yeah. Like, if they were basically
an optimistic, jovial person...

656
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:36,662
...they're now an optimistic, jovial
person in a wheelchair.

657
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:38,865
If they're a petty, miserable asshole...

658
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:42,903
...they're a petty, miserable asshole
with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.

659
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:46,441
So I'll be forever depressed
no matter what great things happen?

660
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,067
- Definitely.
- Great.

661
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,929
No, come on, are you depressed now?

662
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:52,363
No, no, I'm not depressed.

663
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:55,189
But sometimes I worry
I'll get to the end of my life...

664
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:58,855
...feeling I haven't done all I wanted to.
- Well, what do you want to do?

665
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:00,815
I...

666
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:03,966
I want to paint more,
I want to play my guitar every day.

667
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:07,337
I want to learn Chinese.
I want to write more songs.

668
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:11,796
There's so many things I want to do,
and I end up doing not much.

669
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:18,496
All right, well, let me ask you this:
Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?

670
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,224
No.

671
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:21,722
- No?
- No.

672
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,545
- Okay, what about reincarnation?
- Not at all.

673
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,747
- God?
- No.

674
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,387
- All right.
- That sounds terrible. No, no, no.

675
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:34,421
But I don't want to be one of those
people that don't believe in any magic.

676
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,585
- So then, astrology?
- Yes, of course!

677
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,592
- There we go.
- That makes sense, right?

678
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:42,118
You're a Scorpio,
I'm a Sag, we get along.

679
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,931
No, no, no.

680
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:48,093
There's an Einstein quote
I really, really like.

681
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:51,749
He said, "If you don't believe
in any kind of magic or mystery...

682
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:54,782
...you're basically as good as dead. "
- Yeah, I like that.

683
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:58,263
I've always felt there was some kind of
mystical core to the universe.

684
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:03,564
But, more recently, I've started to think
that, me, my personality, whatever...

685
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,908
That I don't have any permanent
place here, you know.

686
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:08,795
In eternity or whatever, you know.

687
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,714
And the more I think that, I can't go
through life saying this is no big deal.

688
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,399
This is it. This is actually happening.
What do you think is interesting?

689
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,783
What do you think is funny?
What is important?

690
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,285
You know, every day's our last.

691
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,116
When I feel that way, I usually
call my mom to tell her I love her.

692
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,988
- Yeah?
- And she's always:

693
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:31,182
"Are you okay? Do you have cancer?
Are you gonna commit suicide?"

694
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,033
It's almost not worth it.

695
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,030
So, what about us?

696
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,752
- What about us?
- No, what I mean is...

697
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:44,465
...if we were both going to die tonight...
- Like the apocalypse was coming?

698
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,742
No, that's too dramatic... But what if
just the two of us were going to die?

699
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,956
I mean, would we talk
about your book?

700
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:53,845
- The environment? Or...
- If today was our last day?

701
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,639
Yeah, what would we talk about?
What would you tell me?

702
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,399
- Well...
- That's hard, huh?

703
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,904
- No, no, I'll do it.
- Okay.

704
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:02,486
I definitely would
stop talking about my book.

705
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,319
- I would probably drop the environment.
- Okay.

706
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:09,383
But I would still want to talk about,
you know, the magic in the universe.

707
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:12,796
- I'd just want to do it from a...
- What?

708
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,661
...a hotel room, you know...

709
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:18,525
...in between sessions of us
wildly fucking until we die.

710
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:21,577
Wow. Well, why waste time
with an hotel room?

711
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:25,137
Why not do it right there on a bench?

712
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,307
Come here, come here, come here.

713
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,885
Okay. We're not gonna die tonight.

714
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:33,118
All right. Too bad. I'm sorry.

715
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,852
That was an extreme example.

716
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,438
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

717
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,303
What I... My point was, you know...

718
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,265
...to truly communicate with
people is very hard to do.

719
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:45,222
No, I know, most of our
day-to-day exchanges...

720
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,989
Yeah, no, I mean...

721
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,734
...not to bring everything back to sex...
- But why not?

722
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:53,007
No, this example, this friend of mine,
she was talking about...

723
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:56,221
- She and her boyfriend... Problems in bed.
- Right.

724
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,919
And how when they had been dating
for a year she started telling him...

725
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:03,111
...what he could do to please her more,
and it freaked him out.

726
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:04,677
- Why?
- Totally.

727
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:06,857
He thought it meant
he was a bad lover...

728
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,912
Maybe she shouldn't have
waited so long.

729
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,434
- After a year...
- But men are so easily offended.

730
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,092
- What, more than women?
- Definitely on that subject.

731
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:15,691
- You think so?
- Yeah, yeah.

732
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,535
Well, maybe it's because, you know...

733
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:22,672
...men are easier to... To please.
- To please?

734
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,926
- Well, I don't know.
- Yeah, they are. They're definitely.

735
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:28,295
Anyway, this friend,
she was telling me...

736
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:32,068
...next time she dates a man,
she's gonna make a little questionnaire...

737
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,700
...about what they like and dislike...
- What, written down, or out loud?

738
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,691
Yeah, mostly written down.

739
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:41,452
But it wouldn't be just yes or no.
It would be a bit more complex than that.

740
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:45,131
Like, for example, if the question is:
"Are you into S & M?"

741
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:50,075
The answer could be: "No, but a good
spanking once in a while doesn't hurt. "

742
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,999
Right, or like:
"Do you like talking dirty in bed?"

743
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:57,639
- That kind of thing?
- Yeah, but not just like any dirty talk.

744
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:00,232
Just "What specific word
would you like to hear?"

745
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:01,776
- What, me?
- Well, yeah.

746
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:04,563
For example what specific word
would you like to hear?

747
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,397
I don't know.

748
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,401
What do you feel about the word
"pussy"?

749
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:13,352
I love it.

750
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,440
Good.

751
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:18,562
It's amazing what perverts we've
become in the past nine years.

752
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:22,004
At least now we don't have to pretend
each new sexual experience...

753
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:23,953
...is, like, a life-altering event.

754
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:27,548
I know. By now, you've stuck it in
so many places it's about to fall off.

755
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:31,411
And I can't realistically expect you've
become anything but a total ho.

756
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:35,017
- Yeah, thank you.
- No, I'm s...

757
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:38,623
- That's true. What can you do?
- What can you do?

758
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:42,544
So, what kind of songs do you write?
I didn't know you did that.

759
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:44,026
- What kind?
- Yeah, sure.

760
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,846
- I don't know, just songs.
- Like?

761
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,649
Like, some are about,
you know, people.

762
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,517
Relationships. One's about my cat.

763
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,149
- Sing one.
- No, I can't. I don't have a guitar.

764
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,943
- Come on. A cappella.
- No, no, no.

765
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:58,218
I'm not singing a song without a guitar.
You're nuts.

766
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,683
Why not?

767
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:03,292
- No, okay. Not now. No.
- One.

768
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:06,682
If not now, when? You want to meet
here in six months with a guitar?

769
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:08,418
I'll fly all the way over here.

770
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:11,531
- You may or may not make the Métro.
- Okay, that's funny.

771
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:14,023
- We've got to get back.
- We'll be all right.

772
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:16,195
- You're gonna miss your flight.
- All right.

773
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:18,205
<i>We can walk down La Seine.
It's nice.</i>

774
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:19,968
Okay.

775
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:24,172
- So you're flying back to New York?
- Yeah, yeah.

776
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:30,000
So I read in that article that
you're married with a kid. That's great.

777
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:32,731
Yeah, he's... He's 4.

778
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:35,127
- What's his name?
- Henry. Little Hank.

779
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:38,061
- He's so much fun.
- Oh, wow, I'm sure.

780
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,183
- Your wife, what does she do?
- She teaches elementary school.

781
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,321
- Do you have kids?
- Yes, two... Shit!

782
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,005
- What?
- I left them in the car!

783
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:48,792
With the windows up, six months ago!
Think they're okay?

784
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,583
No, I'm kidding.
No, but I want to have kids someday.

785
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:53,660
- I'm just not ready yet.
- No?

786
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:56,944
- I'm in a good relationship, though.
- Oh yeah? That's good.

787
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,234
- What's he do?
- He's a photojournalist.

788
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,248
He does war coverage.

789
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:03,966
He's away a lot, which is good
because I'm so busy.

790
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,163
But isn't that dangerous? Aren't a lot of
those guys getting killed these days?

791
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:11,622
He promises me he doesn't take risks,
but I often worry.

792
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,359
He goes in this trance when
he photographs something.

793
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:17,833
- What do you mean?
- Well, once we were in New Delhi...

794
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:19,572
...and we passed a bum on the...

795
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:21,958
- A bomb?
- A bum. A homeless.

796
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,501
All right, right.

797
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:27,403
He looked like he needed help, but his
first reaction was to photograph him.

798
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:30,451
He went really close to his face,
fixing his collar...

799
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:32,407
...totally detached from the person.

800
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:35,293
But don't you have to be like that
to be good at that job?

801
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:36,847
Yeah, I mean, I'm not...

802
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:40,067
I'm not judging him.
What he does is essential and incredible.

803
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,406
All I'm saying is that
I could never do it.

804
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:44,336
Let's get on that boat. Come on.

805
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:45,856
- No!
- Come on, it'll be fun.

806
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:48,314
- You don't have time!
- They're about to take off.

807
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:50,895
I've got 5 more minutes.
Do you have a cell phone?

808
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,402
- Yeah.
- All right, I've got that driver's number.

809
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,745
I can call him to pick us up
at the next stop.

810
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:59,720
I've never been on those boats.
It's for tourists, it's embarrassing.

811
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:01,330
Okay. All right.

812
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,369
No, I'll get it, I'll get it.

813
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,698
All right. All right, all right.

814
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,594
Thank you.

815
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:16,891
- So are you in love with that guy?
- What guy?

816
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:20,354
- The war photographer.
- Yes, of course.

817
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,405
So do you have that cell phone?

818
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,338
Oh, yeah.

819
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,337
- Okay, let's see...
- Okay.

820
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:31,861
What do I tell him?

821
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:34,204
<i>Tell him to pick you up at
Quai Henri Quatre.</i>

822
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:37,139
<i>Oh, shit. Quai...?</i>

823
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,100
<i>Henri Quatre. Quai Henri Quatre.</i>

824
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:42,344
<i>Henri Quatre.</i>

825
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,477
<i>What's wrong with you? No, do you
want me to...? Henri Quatre.</i>

826
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:47,088
- Henry Four?
- Yes!

827
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:50,190
- Come on, why didn't you say so?
- I'm sorry. Okay.

828
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,283
Yeah, is this Philippe?

829
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:07,097
Yeah. Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace.

830
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,693
Yeah.

831
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:12,990
Well, listen, I'm on
one of those boats, right?

832
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:16,136
And we're gonna arrive at Henry Four.

833
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:19,655
At Port Henry Four.
You know what that is?

834
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:22,358
All right, great.
And you have my bags, right?

835
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,472
Yeah, so we'll be there in...
I don't know, it's the next stop.

836
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,042
Okay. Au revoir.

837
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:31,584
- It's okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

838
00:45:31,856 --> 00:45:33,733
Oh, wow.

839
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:36,578
- Notre Dame, man. Check that out.
- Oh, wow.

840
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:40,695
I heard this story once about when
the Germans were occupying Paris...

841
00:45:41,032 --> 00:45:42,590
...and they had to retreat back.

842
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,703
They wired Notre Dame to blow...

843
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:49,026
...but they had to leave one guy
in charge of hitting the switch.

844
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:52,332
And the guy, the soldier,
he couldn't do it.

845
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:56,176
He just sat there, knocked out
by how beautiful the place was.

846
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:58,303
Then, when the Allied troops
came in...

847
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,906
...they found all the explosives
lying there and the switch unturned...

848
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,735
...and they found the same thing
at the Sacré-Coeur, Eiffel Tower...

849
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,252
...couple other places, I think.

850
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:10,395
Is that true?

851
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:13,603
I don't know.
I always liked the story, though.

852
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:15,217
Yeah, that's a great story.

853
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:18,236
But you have to think that Notre Dame
will be gone one day.

854
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:21,565
There used to be another church
at the Seine, right there.

855
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,584
- What, right in the same spot?
- Yeah.

856
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,516
You know, this is great.
I've never done this.

857
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:31,302
- Yeah.
- I forget about how beautiful Paris is.

858
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,141
It's not so bad, being a tourist.

859
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:35,765
- Thanks for getting me on the boat.
- You're welcome.

860
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,844
I think that book that I wrote
was like building something...

861
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:43,459
...so that I wouldn't forget the details
of the time that we spent together.

862
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:47,440
You know, like, just as a reminder,
that once, we really did meet.

863
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:50,599
You know, that this was real,
this happened.

864
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:52,805
I'm happy you're saying that,
because...

865
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:57,181
I mean, I always feel like a freak because
I'm never able to move on like this:

866
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:01,636
People just have an affair,
or even entire relationships...

867
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:04,263
...they break up and they forget.

868
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:08,241
They move on like they would have
changed brand of cereals.

869
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:12,154
I feel I was never able to forget
anyone I've been with...

870
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:17,815
...because each person had their own
specific qualities.

871
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:22,843
You can never replace anyone.
What is lost is lost.

872
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:28,212
Each relationship, when it ends,
really damages me. I never fully recover.

873
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:31,593
That's why I'm very careful
with getting involved...

874
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:33,849
...because it hurts too much.

875
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:37,141
Even getting laid,
I actually don't do that...

876
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,238
...because I will miss of the person
the most mundane things.

877
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:43,121
Like I'm obsessed with little things.

878
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:45,801
Maybe I'm crazy,
but when I was a little girl...

879
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:48,872
...my mom told me
that I was always late to school.

880
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,435
One day she followed me to see why.

881
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:55,864
I was looking at chestnuts falling from
the trees, rolling on the sidewalk...

882
00:47:56,209 --> 00:48:01,727
...or ants crossing the road, the way
a leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk.

883
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:04,088
Little things.

884
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:06,428
I think it's the same with people.

885
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,810
I see in them little details,
so specific to each of them...

886
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:14,057
...that move me and that I miss
and will always miss.

887
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:15,827
You can never replace anyone...

888
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:19,850
...because everyone is made of such
beautiful, specific details.

889
00:48:23,486 --> 00:48:26,637
Like, I remember the way your beard
has a bit of red in it...

890
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:30,092
...and how the sun
was making it glow...

891
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,083
...that morning right before you left.

892
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:37,876
I remembered that, and I missed it.

893
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:39,483
Really crazy, right?

894
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,924
Now I know for sure. You wanna
know why I wrote that stupid book?

895
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:47,097
- Why?
- So you'd come to a reading in Paris...

896
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:51,420
...and I could walk up to you and ask,
"Where the fuck were you?"

897
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,131
No... You think I'd be here today?

898
00:48:54,392 --> 00:48:58,749
I'm serious. I think I wrote it,
in a way, to try to find you.

899
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:01,138
Okay, that's... I know that's not true...

900
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:03,629
...but that's sweet of you.
- I think it is true.

901
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:06,298
What were the chances
of us ever meeting again?

902
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:10,269
After that December,
I'd say almost zero.

903
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:12,781
But we're not real anyway, right?

904
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:16,108
We're just characters
in that old lady's dream.

905
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:18,723
She's on her deathbed,
fantasizing about her youth.

906
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,991
So of course we had to meet again.

907
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:25,006
Oh, God. Why weren't you there
in Vienna?

908
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:29,936
- I told you why.
- I know why, I just...

909
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:32,411
I wish you would have been.

910
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,831
Our lives might have been
so much different.

911
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,216
You think so?

912
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,035
I actually do.

913
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:42,304
Maybe not. Maybe we would have
hated each other eventually.

914
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:45,402
What, like we hate each other now?

915
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:50,756
You know, maybe we're...
We're only good at brief encounters...

916
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:55,155
...walking around in European cities,
in warm climate.

917
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,821
Oh, God. Why didn't we
exchange phone numbers and stuff?

918
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:01,194
Why didn't we do that?

919
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:03,734
Because we were young and stupid.

920
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:06,199
Do you think we still are?

921
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:08,500
I guess when you're young
you just believe...

922
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:11,192
...there'll be many people
you'll connect with.

923
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,484
Later in life you realize
it only happens a few times.

924
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:18,234
And you can screw it up, you know.
Misconnect.

925
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:20,910
The past is the past.
It was meant to be that way.

926
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:23,747
You really believe that?
That everything's fated?

927
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:27,858
Well, you know, the world might be
less free than we think.

928
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:29,832
Yeah?

929
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:33,909
When given these exact circumstances,
that's what will happen every time.

930
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:37,154
Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen,
you'll get water every time.

931
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:40,730
No, I mean, what if your grandmother
had lived a week longer, you know?

932
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,555
Or passed away a week earlier?
Days, even?

933
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:45,348
Things might have been different.

934
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:49,626
- You can't think like that, it's...
- You shouldn't on most things, but...

935
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:54,960
It's just, on this one, it seemed like
something was off, you know.

936
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,275
In the months leading up to my wedding,
I was thinking about you all the time.

937
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:03,276
Even on my way there, I'm in the car, a
buddy of mine is driving me downtown...

938
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:06,244
...and I'm staring out the window
and I think I see you...

939
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:08,594
...not far from the church, right...

940
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,249
...folding up an umbrella
and walking into a deli...

941
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:14,999
...on the corner of 3th and Broadway.

942
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:18,715
And I thought I was going crazy.
But now I think it probably was you.

943
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,177
I lived on th and Broadway.

944
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,880
You see?

945
00:51:26,252 --> 00:51:29,847
So, what is it like to be married?
You haven't talked much about that.

946
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:34,314
I haven't? How weird.

947
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:38,757
I don't know. We met, you know,
when I was in college.

948
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:45,208
And we broke up and got back together
for a period of years, and then...

949
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:50,145
What? We were sort of back together
and she was pregnant...

950
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:52,499
...so marriage.

951
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:54,693
What is she like?

952
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,860
She's a great teacher, a good mom.

953
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,071
She's smart, pretty, you know.

954
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,362
I remember thinking at the time...

955
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:05,898
...that so many of the men
that I admired most...

956
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:10,797
...that their lives were dedicated to
something greater than themselves.

957
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:14,350
So you got married because
men you admired were married?

958
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:20,630
No, no. It's more like I had this...
This idea of my best self, you know?

959
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:22,729
And I wanted to pursue that...

960
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:25,615
...even if it might have been
overriding my honest self.

961
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:27,248
You know what I'm saying?

962
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,837
In the moment, I remember thinking
it didn't much matter, the who of it all.

963
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:34,624
I mean, that nobody is gonna be
everything to you...

964
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:37,657
...and that it's just the action
of committing yourself...

965
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:41,305
...you know, meeting
your responsibilities, that matters.

966
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:45,089
I mean, what is love, right,
if it's not respect, trust, admiration?

967
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:48,373
And I... I felt all those things.

968
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,421
Cut to the present,
and I feel like I'm running a nursery...

969
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:54,273
...with somebody I used to date,
you know.

970
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:56,301
I mean, I'm like a monk, you know.

971
00:52:56,551 --> 00:53:01,227
I mean, I've had sex less than 0 times
in the last four years.

972
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:04,399
- What, what? You laughing at me?
- No.

973
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:07,403
- It sounds pathetic?
- What monastery do monks have sex...?

974
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:10,884
Okay, you're right, I'm doing better
than most monks.

975
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:13,580
But I do, I feel like if somebody
were to touch me...

976
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,976
...I would dissolve into molecules.

977
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:18,876
Well, we're here. We've gotta go.
Come on.

978
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:20,954
Shit.

979
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:36,379
- I'm sorry to hear that, you know.
- What?

980
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:39,633
You're not that happy
with your marriage.

981
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:42,488
- This friend of mine, she's a shrink...
- How's she doing?

982
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:44,277
She's a mess, but...

983
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:47,633
No, she said she's been dealing
with couples that are breaking up...

984
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:50,006
...for the same reason.
- What reason is that?

985
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:52,910
They all expected, after a few
years of living together...

986
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:55,421
...for the passion, that desire,
to be the same.

987
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,093
- Yeah, right.
- It's impossible.

988
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,594
And thank God...

989
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:02,417
...we'd end up with aneurysms in that
constant state of excitement, right?

990
00:54:02,742 --> 00:54:04,460
We'd do nothing at all
with our lives.

991
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:08,059
Would you have finished your book
if you were fucking every five minutes?

992
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,841
I might have welcomed the challenge,
I mean...

993
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,806
It's natural for your wife
after the birth of your son...

994
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:16,601
...to give all her love to the little one.
- Of course.

995
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:19,918
If she was obsessed with sex,
riding you like a wildcat...

996
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:21,890
That wouldn't make any sense, right?

997
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:25,573
Everything you're saying makes sense.
It's not about sex.

998
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,006
No, I know. It's obvious.

999
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:29,781
I...

1000
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:34,051
You know, couples
are so confused lately.

1001
00:54:34,357 --> 00:54:36,552
I think it must be that...

1002
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:40,606
...men need to feel essential
and they don't anymore.

1003
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:43,381
It's been imprinted in their head
for so many years...

1004
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:45,296
...that they had to be the provider.

1005
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:49,050
Like, I'm a strong, independent woman
in my professional life.

1006
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:50,851
I don't need a man to feed me...

1007
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:54,279
...but I still need a man to love me
and that I could love.

1008
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:58,355
- So your driver's here.
- Yeah.

1009
00:54:58,673 --> 00:55:00,265
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1010
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:02,100
- You better give me your...
- No, no.

1011
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:04,460
Why don't we just
give you a ride home?

1012
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:06,951
- Well, I can take the Métro. I'm fine.
- No, I...

1013
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:10,056
My flight's not until 0.
I'll be arriving two hours early.

1014
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:11,705
This way we can keep talking.

1015
00:55:11,936 --> 00:55:13,972
- Monsieur, can...?
- It's not on the way.

1016
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:30,659
You told him where you are
and all that?

1017
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,472
Yeah.

1018
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:38,232
- He knows where he's going?
- Yes.

1019
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:40,302
Glad somebody does.

1020
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:44,507
- But this is better than the Métro, right?
- Definitely.

1021
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:51,329
I was thinking, for me it's better I don't
romanticize things as much anymore.

1022
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,482
I was suffering so much all the time.

1023
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:57,084
I still have lots of dreams,
but they're not in regard to my love life.

1024
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,715
It doesn't make me sad,
it's just the way it is.

1025
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:03,985
Is that why you're in a relationship
with somebody who's never around?

1026
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:08,076
Yes, obviously I can't deal with
the day-to-day life of a relationship.

1027
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,401
Yeah, we have this
exciting time together...

1028
00:56:10,662 --> 00:56:13,893
...and he leaves and I miss him,
but at least I'm not dying inside.

1029
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:16,516
When someone's always around me,
I'm suffocating.

1030
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:19,588
No, wait, you just said
that you need to love and be loved.

1031
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:22,640
Yeah, but when I do,
it quickly makes me nauseous.

1032
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:24,323
It's a disaster.

1033
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:27,111
I mean, I'm really happy
only when I'm on my own.

1034
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:32,063
Even being alone, it's better than sitting
next to a lover and feeling lonely.

1035
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:34,765
It's not so easy for me
to be a romantic.

1036
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,376
You start off that way, and after
you've been screwed over a few times...

1037
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,842
...you forget about your delusional ideas
and you take what comes into your life.

1038
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,084
That's not even true.
I haven't been screwed over...

1039
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:48,673
...I've just had too many
blah relationships.

1040
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:50,702
They weren't mean,
they cared for me...

1041
00:56:50,952 --> 00:56:54,308
...but there were no real connection
or excitement.

1042
00:56:54,622 --> 00:56:56,692
At least, not from my side.

1043
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:59,518
God, I'm sorry, is it really that bad?

1044
00:56:59,794 --> 00:57:01,750
It's not, right?

1045
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:05,728
You know, it's not even that.
I was...

1046
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:09,046
I was fine until I read
your fucking book.

1047
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:11,271
It stirred shit up, you know?

1048
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:14,237
It reminded me how
genuinely romantic I was...

1049
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:16,587
...how I had so much hope in things...

1050
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:20,243
...and now it's like I don't believe
in anything that relates to love.

1051
00:57:20,565 --> 00:57:22,476
I don't feel things for people anymore.

1052
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:27,208
In a way, I put all my romanticism
into that one night...

1053
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,919
...and I was never able to feel
all this again.

1054
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,634
Like, somehow this night
took things away from me...

1055
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,220
...and I expressed them to you,
and you took them with you.

1056
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:37,294
It made me feel cold,
like love wasn't for me.

1057
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,179
I don't believe that.
I don't believe that.

1058
00:57:41,544 --> 00:57:45,617
You know what? Reality and love
are almost contradictory for me.

1059
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:50,083
It's funny, every single of my exes,
they're now married.

1060
00:57:50,428 --> 00:57:53,226
Men go out with me, we break up,
and then they get married.

1061
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:56,871
And later they call me to thank me
for teaching them what love is...

1062
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:59,574
...and that I taught them to care
and respect women.

1063
00:57:59,854 --> 00:58:02,129
- I think I'm one of those.
- I want to kill them!

1064
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,910
Why didn't they ask me? I would have
said no, but they could have asked!

1065
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:09,865
I know it's my fault because
I never felt it was the right man.

1066
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,312
Never. But what does it mean,
the right man, the love of your life?

1067
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:16,815
The concept is absurd. We can only be
complete with another person.

1068
00:58:17,163 --> 00:58:19,438
- It's evil, right?
- Can I talk?

1069
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:22,984
I guess I've been heartbroken
too many times and then I recovered.

1070
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:25,808
So now, you know, from the starts,
I make no effort.

1071
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:28,762
- I know it's not gonna work out.
- You can't do that.

1072
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:30,889
You can't live trying to avoid pain...

1073
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:32,895
...at the expense...
- Those are words.

1074
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:34,537
I've gotta get away from you.

1075
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:36,842
- Stop the car, I wanna get out.
- No, don't...

1076
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:38,939
- Keep talking.
- It's being around you.

1077
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:41,460
Don't touch me, you know.
I want to get on a cab.

1078
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:46,583
No, don't. No, no, keep going.

1079
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,296
Listen, I'm just so happy...
Thank you, just keep going.

1080
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:52,251
All right.

1081
00:58:53,658 --> 00:58:57,253
Look, I'm just so happy,
all right, to be with you.

1082
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:00,810
I am. I'm so glad you didn't
forget about me, okay?

1083
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:03,718
No, I didn't.
And it pisses me off, okay?

1084
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:07,559
You come here to Paris,
all romantic, and married.

1085
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,280
Okay? Screw you.

1086
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:12,450
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not trying to get you.

1087
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:15,074
I mean, all I need is a married man.

1088
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:19,002
There's been so much water under
the bridge, it's not even about you.

1089
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:21,664
It's about that moment in time
that's forever gone.

1090
00:59:21,978 --> 00:59:24,776
You say that, but you didn't
even remember having sex, so...

1091
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,818
Of course I remembered.

1092
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:31,378
- You did?
- Yes.

1093
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:34,886
- Women pretend things like that.
- They do?

1094
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:39,029
What was I supposed to say?
That I remember the wine in the park...

1095
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:42,727
...and us looking up at the stars fading
away as the sun came up?

1096
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,272
We had sex twice, you idiot!

1097
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:51,425
All right, you know what,
I'm just happy to see you.

1098
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,076
Even if you've become an angry,
manic-depressive activist...

1099
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:58,743
...I still like you,
I still enjoy being around you.

1100
00:59:59,557 --> 01:00:03,755
And I feel the same. I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened, I just...

1101
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:06,459
- I had to let it all out.
- Don't worry about it.

1102
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:09,245
I'm so miserable in my love life,
in my relationship.

1103
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:12,563
I always act as...
Like, you know, I'm detached.

1104
01:00:12,862 --> 01:00:15,899
But I'm dying inside.
I'm dying because I'm so numb.

1105
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:19,794
I don't feel pain or excitement,
I'm not even bitter, I'm just...

1106
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,680
You think you're the one
dying inside?

1107
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:26,995
My life is 24/7 bad.

1108
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:28,609
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

1109
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:31,635
I mean, the only happiness I get
is when I'm out with my son.

1110
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:33,515
I've been to marriage counseling...

1111
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:36,272
...I've done things I never thought
I would have to do.

1112
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:39,386
I've lit candles,
bought self-help books, lingerie.

1113
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,956
- Did the candles help?
- Hell, no.

1114
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:44,614
I don't love her the way
she needs to be loved...

1115
01:00:44,894 --> 01:00:49,172
...and I don't even see a future for us,
but then I look at my little boy...

1116
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:52,755
...sitting across from me,
and I think I'd suffer any torture...

1117
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:55,344
...to be with him for
all the minutes of his life.

1118
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:57,410
I don't want to miss out on one.

1119
01:00:57,657 --> 01:01:01,809
But then, there's no joy or laughter
in my home, you know?

1120
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:05,711
- I don't want him growing up in that.
- No laughter? That's terrible.

1121
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,872
My parents have been
together 35 years...

1122
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:10,356
...and even when they fight
they end up laughing.

1123
01:01:10,628 --> 01:01:14,257
I don't want to be one of those people
who are getting divorced at 52...

1124
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:18,823
...and falling down into tears, admitting
they never really loved their spouse...

1125
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:24,014
...and they feel their life has been
sucked up into a vacuum cleaner.

1126
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:27,870
You know, I want a great life.
I want her to have a great life...

1127
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:30,299
...she deserves that.

1128
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:33,804
But we're just living in the pretense
of a marriage, responsibility...

1129
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,944
...you know, all these ideas
of how people are supposed to live.

1130
01:01:39,824 --> 01:01:43,533
But then I... I have these dreams...

1131
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:46,524
What dreams?

1132
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:50,104
I have these dreams,
you know, that...

1133
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,621
...I'm standing on a platform...

1134
01:01:54,005 --> 01:01:56,997
...and you keep going by on a train...

1135
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,532
...and you go by, and you go by,
and you go by, you go by.

1136
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:03,685
And I wake up with
the fucking sweats.

1137
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,127
And then I have this other dream...

1138
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:10,109
...where you're pregnant in bed
beside me naked...

1139
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,109
...and I want so badly to touch you, but
you tell me not to and you look away.

1140
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:18,754
And I... And I touch you anyway...

1141
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:23,392
...right on your ankle, and your skin is
so soft that I wake up in sobs, all right?

1142
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:27,637
My wife is there looking at me,
and I feel I'm a million miles from her.

1143
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:31,835
And I know that there's
something wrong, that I...

1144
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:34,079
God, that I can't keep living like this...

1145
01:02:34,337 --> 01:02:36,771
...that there's gotta be more to love
than commitment.

1146
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,763
But then I think that
I might have given up...

1147
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:41,882
...on the whole idea of romantic love.

1148
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:45,288
That I might have put it
to bed that...

1149
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:48,237
That day when you weren't there.

1150
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:51,157
You know, I think I might
have done that.

1151
01:02:52,522 --> 01:02:54,638
Why are you telling me all this?

1152
01:02:55,608 --> 01:02:59,647
I'm sorry. I don't know.
I'm... I should...

1153
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:02,866
I shouldn't have.

1154
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:04,629
You know, it's so weird.

1155
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:08,747
People think they are the only one
going through tough times.

1156
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:13,240
I mean, when I read the article,
I thought your life was perfect.

1157
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,464
A wife, a kid, published author.

1158
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:21,487
But your personal life
is more of a mess than mine.

1159
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:24,031
I'm sorry.

1160
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:27,296
Well, I'm glad it's good for something.

1161
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:33,260
- This is where you live?
- Yeah.

1162
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:38,307
So you're just relieved that I'm
in even more deep shit than you are?

1163
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:40,449
Yes, you've made me feel better.

1164
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,765
Oh, good, I'm glad.

1165
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:45,386
No, I really wish you the best.

1166
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:49,174
It's not because I'm incapable of having
a good relationship or a family...

1167
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:51,532
...that I wish everyone to be
doomed like me.

1168
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,065
I'm sure you'd make... Be
a great mom someday.

1169
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:55,767
- Really? You think so?
- Yeah...

1170
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:58,994
...a few antidepressants, you know,
you'll do great.

1171
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:02,642
- Okay, say stop.
- Stop.

1172
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:05,812
- Okay.
- You ready? Okay.

1173
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:20,103
- So I want to try something.
- What?

1174
01:04:22,737 --> 01:04:26,889
I want to see if you stay together
or if you dissolve into molecules.

1175
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:29,995
How am I doing?

1176
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:32,076
Still here.

1177
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,400
Good. I like being here.

1178
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:39,891
Is this your apartment?

1179
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,768
No, I live down there.

1180
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:44,157
- Down there?
- Yeah.

1181
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:46,815
Monsieur, I'm gonna walk her
to her door.

1182
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,253
This is incredible.

1183
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,074
- This is where you live?
- Yeah.

1184
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:03,430
- How long have you been here?
- Four years.

1185
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:07,183
- So tell me...
- What?

1186
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:09,041
Is it all true about your dreams...

1187
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:11,923
...or did you say that to hopefully
get in my pants?

1188
01:05:12,203 --> 01:05:13,716
I said that to get in your pants.

1189
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:16,344
- I use that all the time.
- Oh, okay. Does it work?

1190
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,419
You know. Sometimes.

1191
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:24,068
Here's my kitty. Oh, so cute.
Look at him.

1192
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:26,134
You know what I love
about this cat?

1193
01:05:26,384 --> 01:05:28,579
Every morning I bring him
to the courtyard...

1194
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:33,403
...and every single morning he looks
at everything like it was the first time.

1195
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:37,680
Every corner, every tree, every plant.

1196
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,376
Smells everything
with his little cute nose.

1197
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:44,562
Oh, I love my kitty. I love my kitty.

1198
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:47,784
- What's his name?
- Che.

1199
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:50,328
Che?

1200
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:54,386
- What?
- Commie.

1201
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:58,833
No, "che" in Argentina means "hey. "

1202
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:01,434
- Okay.
- Yes.

1203
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:05,306
Oh, baby. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1204
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:12,477
We're having a little party.
It's so much fun.

1205
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:24,568
- So...
- So.

1206
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:45,112
You know what? I was thinking,
would you play me one of your songs?

1207
01:06:45,463 --> 01:06:47,533
- You're gonna miss your flight.
- I won't.

1208
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:50,597
I'm gonna be in the airport for
over an hour, reading...

1209
01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:53,683
...wishing you'd played me
one of your songs.

1210
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:56,130
One song? Okay, but quickly.

1211
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:58,109
Okay.

1212
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:06,595
God, I love these old staircases.

1213
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,218
- Hold this.
- What, for me?

1214
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:49,440
Hey there, buddy.

1215
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:52,603
Che.

1216
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:07,796
- Would you like some tea?
- Yeah, sure.

1217
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:10,021
Wow.

1218
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:14,447
- Is chamomile okay?
- Yeah. Great.

1219
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,911
<i>- Merci.
- Messy?</i>

1220
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:20,775
<i>- You think my apartment is messy?
- No, no. Merci.</i>

1221
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:24,491
<i>- Merci beaucoup.
- Ah, merci.</i>

1222
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:28,408
I meant to tell you,
your French has improved a lot.

1223
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:30,007
- Really?
- Yeah.

1224
01:08:30,235 --> 01:08:32,703
Yeah, you've really
mastered the language.

1225
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:36,605
All right, all right, what song
are you gonna play me?

1226
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:41,750
No, I can't. It's too embarrassing.
It's been...

1227
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:45,587
Whoa. No way. No way. I came up here,
you cannot crap out on me now.

1228
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,873
One song. Anything will be great.

1229
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:49,887
But listen, you're gonna laugh at me.

1230
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,563
- You think so?
- Yes.

1231
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,751
I doubt it.

1232
01:08:56,594 --> 01:08:57,947
Okay.

1233
01:08:58,179 --> 01:09:00,454
What do you want to hear? I have...

1234
01:09:00,724 --> 01:09:02,954
I have three songs in English.

1235
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:04,545
One's about my cat...

1236
01:09:04,769 --> 01:09:08,682
...one's about my ex-boyfriend...
Well, ex-ex-boyfriend...

1237
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:11,413
...and there's one about...

1238
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:15,132
Well, it's just a little waltz.

1239
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:17,483
A waltz? Yeah.

1240
01:09:17,782 --> 01:09:19,818
- Play the waltz.
- Right.

1241
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:22,427
I haven't played it in a while.
You sure?

1242
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:27,353
Okay.

1243
01:09:28,168 --> 01:09:30,363
All right, the waltz.

1244
01:09:42,682 --> 01:09:46,994
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1245
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:51,905
<i>Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts</i>

1246
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:56,632
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1247
01:09:56,988 --> 01:10:00,697
<i>About this one-night stand</i>

1248
01:10:01,951 --> 01:10:07,423
<i>You were, for me, that night</i>

1249
01:10:07,832 --> 01:10:13,509
<i>Everything I always dreamt of in life</i>

1250
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:17,312
<i>But now you're gone</i>

1251
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:21,707
<i>You are far-gone</i>

1252
01:10:22,889 --> 01:10:27,360
<i>All the way to your island of rain</i>

1253
01:10:27,727 --> 01:10:33,359
<i>It was, for you, just a one-night thing</i>

1254
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:36,608
<i>But you were much more to me</i>

1255
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:39,539
<i>Just so you know</i>

1256
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:43,577
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

1257
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:48,623
<i>I know what you meant
For me that day</i>

1258
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:53,629
<i>I just want another try</i>

1259
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:58,794
<i>I just want another night</i>

1260
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:05,971
<i>Even if it doesn't seem quite right</i>

1261
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:10,267
<i>You meant, for me, much more</i>

1262
01:11:10,603 --> 01:11:14,755
<i>Than anyone I've met before</i>

1263
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:21,183
<i>One single night with you, little Jesse</i>

1264
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:26,529
<i>Is worth a thousand with anybody</i>

1265
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:31,018
<i>I have no bitterness, my sweet</i>

1266
01:11:31,499 --> 01:11:36,368
<i>I'll never forget this one-night thing</i>

1267
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:42,625
<i>Even tomorrow, in other arms</i>

1268
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:48,844
<i>My heart will stay yours until I die</i>

1269
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:57,867
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1270
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:03,069
<i>Out of nowhere, out of my blues</i>

1271
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:08,203
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1272
01:12:08,578 --> 01:12:13,572
<i>About this lovely one-night stand</i>

1273
01:12:30,892 --> 01:12:34,362
- No, one more! Please, please.
- No! It was our deal.

1274
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:37,084
One... One song. No, no, no.

1275
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:39,833
You can have your tea and then...

1276
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:47,640
- All right, let me ask you one question.
- What?

1277
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:51,060
Do you just plug that name in
for every guy that comes up here?

1278
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:53,062
Yes, of course.

1279
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:57,202
What do you think, that I wrote
the song about you? Are you nuts?

1280
01:13:01,756 --> 01:13:04,031
Is this you? Little cross-eyed Celine?

1281
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,768
- Yes. That's funny.
- Cute.

1282
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:11,539
- Is that your grandmother?
- Yeah.

1283
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:15,426
Oh, wow.

1284
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:18,853
- You want some honey?
- Yeah, sure.

1285
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:10,887
Did you ever see Nina Simone
in concert?

1286
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,593
No, I never did.
I can't believe she's gone.

1287
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:15,470
I know, it's so sad.

1288
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:18,064
Thanks.

1289
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,202
It's hot.

1290
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:25,098
I saw her twice in concert.

1291
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,035
She was so great.

1292
01:14:28,343 --> 01:14:31,221
That's one of my favorite songs of hers.

1293
01:14:47,195 --> 01:14:48,469
She was so great.

1294
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:52,643
She was so funny in concert too.

1295
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:56,902
She would... She would be
right in the middle of a song and then...

1296
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:59,044
...you know, stop...

1297
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:03,203
...and walk from the piano all the way
to the edge of the stage.

1298
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:05,775
Like, really slowly.

1299
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:11,993
And she'd start talking to someone
in the audience.

1300
01:15:12,304 --> 01:15:15,535
"Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

1301
01:15:16,433 --> 01:15:18,583
I love you too. "

1302
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:23,380
And then she'd walk back.
Take her time, no hurry, you know.

1303
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:27,088
She had that big, cute ass.

1304
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:28,881
She would move.

1305
01:15:30,655 --> 01:15:35,285
And then she would go back to the piano
and play some more, you know.

1306
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:38,587
And then she would, I don't know...

1307
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,219
...just start another song
in the middle of another.

1308
01:15:41,499 --> 01:15:45,128
You know, like,
stop again, and be like:

1309
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:49,296
"You over there,
can you move that fan.

1310
01:15:50,383 --> 01:15:52,419
You're cute.

1311
01:16:13,531 --> 01:16:15,442
Oh, yeah. "

1312
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:23,197
Baby, you are gonna miss that plane.

1313
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:26,499
I know.
